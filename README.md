# XM Task Application
This application developed on PHP v8.2, with Symfony Framework v6.2.
Application is fully dockerized. 

Set **RAPIDAPI_KEY**, **MAILER_DSN** and **MAIL_FROM** variables in `.env` file.

For Unix users will be convenient to use `Makefile` commands like: `make --command--`

Windows users can check docker commands in `Makefefile`.

For starting application in `dev` mode use `make start.dev`

For starting application in `prod` mode use `make start.prod`

### Enjoy!!!
